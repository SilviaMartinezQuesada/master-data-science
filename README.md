# Welcome to this repository!

My name is Silvia Quesada and in this repository you can find my final master's work done at KSchool, in May 2019 about the purchase of weapons, migrations and indicators of poverty.

In order to replicate the work done you will need to have access to:

- Python 3
- R 3.3.2

In each file you will find the steps to follow to correctly execute the process.

Also, I recommend you follow the numerical order that identifies the files. For example, first take a look at file 01_Migrations, then file 02_HumanDevelopment, and so on.

It will be necessary to install some packages of both R and Python, but relax, everything is ready in the files. If you need to install a package you will see it at the beginning of the code

#### You will also find a .pdf document in which you will find details of how to navigate in this repository.

In this document you will also find the origin of the information, how to interpret the visualization, some conclusions and the next steps to follow.

Hope you enjoy!
